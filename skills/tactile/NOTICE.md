This skill (`tactile`) is the mobile-first entry point of the ATLAS design system. It mirrors the
structure of the user's **`impeccable`** skill (itself based on Anthropic's Apache-2.0 **frontend-design**)
and wraps the user's **`mobile-app-design`** skill (SK-126) as its principles library. All external sources
below are referenced for their published guidance — no proprietary text is copied verbatim; numeric
facts, role names, and conventions are uncopyrightable and are cited for provenance.

|---|---|---|---|
| the user's `mobile-app-design` (SK-126) — `SKILL.md`, `RN_PITFALLS.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`, `REFERENCES.md` | the user's own | most of `reference/*` + `reference/audit-rules.md` | The 8-rule model, glass/squircle playbook, the 15 RN translation traps, and the 22-item review checklist — reorganized from one review playbook into a per-topic build library + a deterministic detector sheet. SK-126 remains the loaded principles library; its `CHECKLIST.md` is still the canonical manual review list. |
| Anthropic `frontend-design` / the user's `impeccable` | Apache 2.0 | `SKILL.md`, `reference/craft.md`, `reference/audit-rules.md` (structure) | The entry-point pattern: modes (craft/teach), Context Gathering Protocol, `<absolute_bans>` shape, `<font_selection_procedure>`, the AI-slop test, the 5-step craft flow, and the audit-sheet format + mandatory-canary concept. |

`reference/audit-rules.md` uses the `AR-T##` ID prefix to keep its rule namespace distinct from
impeccable's web `AR-##` rules.
